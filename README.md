#codesoft: Java Programming Internship

This internship entails Java programming and involves completing three tasks: [Number Game](#TASK1), [Word Counter](#TASK2), and [ATM Interface](#TASK3).

## TASK 1: NUMBER GAME
* Generate a random number within a specified range, 1 to 100.
* Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
* Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.
* repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
### You can incorporate additional details as follows :
* Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
* Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
* Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

## TASK 2: WORD COUNTER
* Prompt the user to enter a text or provide a file to count the words.
* Read the input text or file and store it in a string.
* Split the string into an array of words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
* initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of words.
* Iterate through the array of words and increment the counter for each word encountered.
* Display the total count of words to the user.
### You can further enhance the project by adding features such as:
* Ignoring common words or stop words.
* Provide statistics like the number of unique words or the frequency of each word.
* Implementing input validation to handle empty inputs or file errors.
* adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

## TASK 3: ATM INTERFACE
* create a class to represent the ATM.
* Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.
* Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().
* Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
* Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.
* Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
* Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
of their transactions.
